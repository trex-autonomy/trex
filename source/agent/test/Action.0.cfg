<!-- Simple test to ensure we can handle actions as inputs in initial conditions and that we can
     correctly buffer them for delibeberation and execution. The input will be a sequence of actions
     which increment a given value timeline. The actions will have flexible duration. A successor will
     will not start until its predecessor ends, since the end times are uncontrollable. -->

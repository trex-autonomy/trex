<!--
 Purpose: Test parallel synchronization.

 Motive:Want to show that a goal with flexible bounds can be dispatched and as time marches on, if not satisfied, its flexibility
        is decreased.
 
 Scenario:
 	One timeline shared by 2 reactors. Internal for A and external for B.
 	Initial numbers is 0.
 	A flexible goal that can occur any time within the horizon is for the value 4. Specified in B.
 	B will look ahead for the whole horizon.
	A will look ahead for tick.

 Expected Result:
	B will start deliberation at tick 0, for [2 10].
	Default observations will conflict with the goal, unless biased bt  a request. So planning must complete first, and dispatch.
	Eventually the temporal scope of the plan is reduced as the goal is squeezed, allowing planning to complete in time.

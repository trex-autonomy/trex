<!--
  Purpose: To ensure derived values are synchronized correctly, including when undefined.

  Scenario:
	2 reactors, each containing a sensor and derived timeline.
	The sensor is the source. There is a simple functional relationship to the derived.
	The sensor is set to be undefined for a section of values.
	The derived should just reflect the sensor

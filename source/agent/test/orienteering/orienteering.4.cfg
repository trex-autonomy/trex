<!--
  Purpose: To ensure that the orienteering solver finds a good result for a set of goals.

  Scenario: The orienteering solver is given four goals. Two of which are estimated to be infeasible after a far-away
            higher priority goal is checked. The far away goal is rejected during the rest of planning and the
	    orienteer must re-plan.

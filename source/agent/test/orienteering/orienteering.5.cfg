<!--
  Purpose: To ensure that the orienteering solver finds a good result for a set of goals.

  Scenario: The orienteer is given a set of goals, which are on an external timeline. The orienteer
  	    must place the goals on the timeline. Because of the system, another reactor, the "breaker"
	    will make the goals take a long time. This means that the orienteer must re-plan. There will be insufficient time
	    left to complete the remaing goal so it will be rejected.

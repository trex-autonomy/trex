<!--
  Purpose: To ensure that we correctly detect a value has expired and generate a repair

  Scenario:
	2 reactors each with the same timeline. The client will require a different value in a particular point
	in time. The client will have no lookahead, and thus the value will be expected but not dispatched since it will
	only be resolved in synchronization.

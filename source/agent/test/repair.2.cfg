<!--
  Purpose: To ensure we correctly back out inconsistency from goals and retain committed observations

  Scenario:
	A ValveController will include an inconsistency in its subgoals which will only be detectable
	during its execution. Thus implications of the goal will have been dispatched and satisfied by
	the server timeline. We should keep the observations that are derived from the goal but reject
	the goal.

 * This token is fundamentally inconsistent. But we do not discover that until we execute it.
 * The question is - do we care about that? If the model is inconsistent, can we reliably reset values?
 * The answer I believe is no - it is just a shot in the dark. So we will not permit a recovery in a case like this.
 * Instead we should consider the reactor terminated and remove it from the agent, along with any of its dependents.

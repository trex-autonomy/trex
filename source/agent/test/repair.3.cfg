<!--
  Purpose: To ensure we correctly blow away a goal that is contradicted by a new observation.

  Scenario:
	A ValveController will require the valve to be open for a minimum duration. The server will open the valve
	during this time. The result should be that the state of the valve controller will be reset to a new inactive value.

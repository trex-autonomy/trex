# This file is a strawman for setting environment variables. It assumes TREX, and PLASMA are peers in the direectory tree. It also assumes that
# the file is sourced from the parent directory of TREX and PLASMA
# 1. TREX - which should point to the TREX root directory
# 2. PLASMA_HOME - which should point to the PLASMA root directory
# 3. TREX_LOG_DIR - which should point to the location for outputting log files generated by the agent.
# 4. LD_LIBRARY_PATH - required for loading shared libraries from PLASMA and TREX 
# 5. PYTHONPATH - required if using any python tools for TREX

About:
    PyGTKCodeBuffer is written in pure Python to provide a maximum portability. 
    It depends only on PyGTK and the Python standard library. No Gnome nor 
    Scintilla libraries are needed it should run perfectly under all platforms
    supported by PyGTK! 


Usage:
    To keep this project lightweight the PyGTKCodeBuffer only provides you a 
    model/buffer for code-viewing/editing. To view a code-buffer simply use the
    default gtk.TextView widget. This buffer provides you a simple way to build
    a editor with syntax-highlight support.   
    
    All the code for PyGTKCodeBuffer is located in one source-file to allow you
    to ship PyGTKCodeBuffer along with your application so your costumers do not
    have to care about having PyGTKCodeBuffer installed. 
    Note: In this case you have to tell PyGTKCodeBuffer where to find the 
          syntax-definitions. Or you "hard-code" the language-grammar.

#summary Log file organization

= Introduction =

TREX can be configured to write various amounts of information to disk, both with the built-in EUROPA logging system as well as additional TREX-specific information.

= Log Directory Location =
Unless otherwise specified at runtime, the base path in which TREX logs are placed is defined in `$TREX_LOG_DIR`. Inside of this directory, log directories for each run are created with the format:
 _year_._day_._run_
Additionally, a symbolic link named _latest_ is made at runtime which points to the latest log.

= Log Directory Contents =

Inside of each of these directories are several files and subdirectories:
|| *File/Directory Name* || *Description* ||
||`TREX.log` || Primary TREX event log ||
||`clock.log` || _deprecated_ ||
||`cpuStat.log` || Reports CPU usage for deliberation and synchronization for each reactor. ||
||`Debug.log` || PLASMA debugging output. ||
||`cfg` || Flat directory which contains copies of all .nddl files and .cfg files that were loaded at runtime.  ||
||_agentname_`.log` || A history of all transactions between the agent and the world. ||

For each reactor there is an additional sub-directory with the format:
 _agentname_._reactorname_
Each of these directories contains the files:

|| *File/Directory Name* || *Description* ||
||`debug.log` || General debugging information relevant to this reactor ||
||`plan.log` || A high-level log of all of the plans created by this reactor ||
||`reactor_states`|| A Flat directory of .reactorstate files ||
||`plans` || Directory of sub-directories from individual ticks with very fine plan information from the EUROPA subsystem.  ||
||`conflicts`|| A flat directory of .conflict files ||
